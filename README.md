# jubilant-sniffle
Upon hearing he had won the award for most fickle respiratory system in his final year of eligibility, he let out a jubilant sniffle.

So, pursuant to the strategy of working my way through a GitHub tutorial in order to more fully understand how to work with Git, GitHub, and other developers on GitHub, I have created this gleaming new repository with a README.md file to describe it. This is that file. I am describing myself.  Is there anyone else?
